        “Let me tell you something you already know. The world aint all sunshine
        and rainbows. Its a very mean and nasty place, and I dont care how tough
        you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently
        if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it
        aint about how hard you hit. Its about how hard you can get hit and keep
        moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. Thats how
        winning is done!”

        "Don't be afraid of fear. Because it sharpens you, it challenges you, it
        makes you stronger; and when you run away from fear, you also run away
        from the opportunity to be your best possible self."

        yourself, belief in your future, you will find your way.
